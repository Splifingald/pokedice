# 38 · The game-feel pass

The changes chosen on the Fix Board after the October 2026 UX review: how the battle, the rewards and the menus look,
sound and feel on a phone, plus the accessibility and simplicity fixes that came with them. The review is
<https://claude.ai/artifact/9cZy7XnTtSkbYzYmMnXxt5>, the board <https://claude.ai/artifact/GmZWQ3rjg7RfmLLViyTEA4>.
Each item keeps its board id (F2a, U3a…), so a change can be traced to the decision behind it.

## 1. The switches

Three admin switches (Admin → Config), each **Off / On for admin / On for everyone, Off by default** (docs/15 §20):

| Switch | `config` key, helper | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Game feel** | `gameFeel`, `gameFeelOn` | The juice: the damage count-up and combo tiers, hits that scale, the KO beat, faster turns, the victory payoff, the catch and progress moments, the extra taps and sounds. Off: everything plays as before |
| **Haptics** | `haptics`, `hapticsOn` | Short vibrations (`src/lib/haptics.ts`), with a Settings switch. Android only: iOS Safari can't vibrate |
| **Battle music** | `music`, `musicOn` | An original 8-bit loop under fights, synthesised like the effects, with a Settings switch |

All three only change how the game looks, sounds and feels on the player's device: the engine has decided everything
first, so no server function acts for them and none reads them, as with the dice throws (docs/37 §7.4). They are
purely sensory, so they have **no rules pop-up and no INFO button** (docs/15 §20).

The bug fixes, the accessibility fixes and the simplifications of existing screens have no switch: they change
features already there.

The new sounds live in `src/audio/feel.ts` (`feelSound`), built from `sfx.ts`'s `tone` and `hiss` on the same Sound
switch; the haptics in `src/lib/haptics.ts` (`haptic(cue)`).

## 7. Accessibility and the shell

## 8. Onboarding, menus and copy

<!-- WP7 -->

## 9. Setting it up

1. Deploy the client. The three switches are Off: nothing changes for anyone until the admin turns them on.
2. Run migration `supabase/migrations/0072_game_feel.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor (it adds the three switches' rows,
   Off, and bumps `configVersion`). `supabase/seed.sql` carries it too, inlined. Safe to run again.
3. Admin → Config: try **Game feel**, **Haptics** and **Battle music** On for admin first, then On for everyone.
4. The board also chose to turn the existing **Dice throws** On for everyone (F8a): Admin → Config → Dice throws.
